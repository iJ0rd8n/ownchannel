# Your Own Channel

A simple Apple TV Template to create your own live tv channel pretty easilly.

1) A free Apple Developper account

2) You will need a Mac running the latest version of XCode & OSX (up to date)

3) You will need a live tv or radio source (format: m3u8, pls), test the link with VLC to make sure it's working.

4) An Apple TV 4th generation (the new one)

5) A USB-C cable to sideload your channel on your Apple TV.

Template is using by default the NASA TV channel, you just need to change the URL in the ViewController.swift to
your own.  Pretty easy.
